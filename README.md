# ALGateway

This is a gateway protocol that can be used to unify access to various applications. For downstream: any application just needs to provide/call the corresponding socket interface according to the specification of this gateway. For upstream: any application using this gateway only needs to use the functions provided by the gateway through the unified interface, and at the same time open the port to receive data back from the gateway. This gateway protocol is a unified protocol, the gateway program implemented is not infected by GPL, AGPL and other protocols.
